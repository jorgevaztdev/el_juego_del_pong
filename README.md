# El Juego del Ping Pong

"El Juego del Ping Pong" â€“ Oh, it's just a little something, a digital diversion, really. You know, a classic Pong game, cobbled together with Python and Pygame. It's not exactly *Annie Hall*, but it's got paddles and a ball. You can even play against a computer, which, let's be honest, is probably less judgmental than most people. We track the scores, because, well, someone has to keep tabs on these things, right? It's a simple, retro experience, a brief respite from the crushing weight of existence, or at least from deciding what to have for dinner.

## Features

-   **AI Opponent:** Play against a computer-controlled paddle.
-   **Score Tracking:** Scores are saved to a `scores.txt` file with timestamps.
-   **Customizable Difficulty:** Choose between Easy, Medium, and Hard difficulties.
-   **Customizable Paddle Color:** Select from White, Light Blue, or Light Red for your paddle.
-   **Pause Menu:** Pause the game to adjust difficulty or paddle color, and resume.
-   **Player Side Selection:** Choose to control the left or right paddle at the start of the game.
-   **Exit Functionality:** Exit the game by pressing `E`.

## How to Run the Game

To run "El Juego del Ping Pong" on your local machine, follow these steps:

### 1. Navigate to the Game Directory

Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the `game_pong` directory:

```bash
cd /home/jorgevazt/Documents/Gemini/game_pong
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

It's highly recommended to create a virtual environment to manage project dependencies and avoid conflicts with your system's Python packages. From within the `game_pong` directory, run:

```

### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment

Activate the newly created virtual environment:

-   **On Linux/macOS:**

    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

-   **On Windows (Command Prompt):**

    ```bash
    .\venv\Scripts\activate.bat
    ```

-   **On Windows (PowerShell):**

    ```powershell
    .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    ```

### 4. Install Dependencies

With the virtual environment activated, install the necessary Python libraries (Pygame):

```bash
pip install pygame
```

### 5. Run the Game

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the game:

```bash
python main.py
```
